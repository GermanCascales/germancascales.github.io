					<p>All the times that you rain on my parade <br />And all the clubs you get in using my name <br />You think you broke my heart <br />Ohhh girl for goodness sake <br />You think I'm crying <br />Oh my ohhh, well no I ain't!</p><br />
<p>And I didn't wanna write a song <br />'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't <br />But, you still hit my phone up <br />And baby I be moving on</p><br />
<p>And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back <br />Maybe you should know that <br />My mama don't like you and she like's everyone <br />And I don't like to admit that I was wrong</p><br />
<p>And I've been so caught up in my job <br />Didn't see what's going on <br />And now I know <br />I'm better sleeping on my own</p><br />
<p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much <br />Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself <br />And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' <br />You should go and love yourself</p><br />
<p>When you told me that you hated my friends <br />The only problem was with you and not them <br />And every time you told my opinion was wrong <br />And tried to make me forget where I came from</p><br />
<p>And I didn't wanna write a song <br />Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't <br />But, you still hit my phone up <br />And baby I be moving on <br />And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back <br />Maybe you should know that <br />My mama don't like you and she like's everyone <br />And I don't like to admit that I was wrong <br />And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on<br />And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own</p><br />
<p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much <br />Oh baby you should go and love yourself <br />And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' <br />You should go and love yourself</p><br />
<p>For all the times you made me feel small <br />I fell in love now I fear nothin' at all <br />I never felt so low when I was vulnerable <br />Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?</p><br />
<p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much <br />Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself <br />And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' <br />You should go and love yourself</p><br />
<p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much <br />Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself <br />And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' <br />You should go and love yourself</p>
